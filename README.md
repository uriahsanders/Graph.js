Graph.js
========

Lightweight, customizable, SVG graphs + jQuery plugin

Example:
--------
http://uriahsanders.github.io/examples/graph.html

Dependancies:
-------------
Just jQuery. (Take a moment to sit back in awe.)

Why?:
------
There are very few JS SVG graphing libraries out there. Most JS graphing libraries use canvas, which is not as sharp or interactive as SVG. I've only found two that use SVG. Google charts and Morris.js. The first is not open source or client side, and Morris.js has 2 additonal dependancies, fewer graphs, no legends, and more code. Graph.js only needs jQuery, and is extremely easy to use with its jQuery plugin (You can also just use the "classes"), or otherwise.

Im working on a big website right now that will need a lot of graphs. So I needed all these things that noone offered. (I hate dependancies, sending my stuff to google servers, and using stuff that's not open source :P). So if you're in the same conundrum use Graph.js! By the way, shout out to my math teacher Mrs.Williams so she knows I can actually do math...somewhat.

Features:
---------
jQuery plugin.

Linear, area, bar, combo, pie, and donut graphs, as well as tables,

Legends for multiple datasets and pie and donut graphs (simple legends for single datasets),

Supports multiple datasets,

Full grids, vertical and horizontal grids, no grids...,

Supports interactivity,

Light-weight,

Can change graphs from one type to another (including tables): graph.to('linear');

Easy to use,

Every inch is customizable,

Contributions Welcome!:
-----------------------
I'm pretty busy with plenty of things right now, so this repo will move forward slowly if it's just me. So please, test and report issues, contribute code, write documentation, star, fork, and all that good stuff :)

Documentation coming soon. Also, when we get 100+ stars cdnjs can host us.

Stuff I'm working on adding:
----------------------------
Prettier looking graphs by default (esspecially tooltips),

Animations on first appearance,

Function graphs (Last really important graph to add),

X and Y axis names,

An update function that works like it should,

Documentation,

Better/more examples,

Client side UI for creating graphs
